## TODO LIST FILE ##
# Created for managing tasks todo 

1. Need to rework parsing logic of files.
Let the '{' and '}' be main stickers for parsing boundary parts;
When parsing file the string above '{' must be readed as plane name and context between '{' and '}'
must be interpreted as appropriate values.

2. Need to rework after-parsing logic when backup files are loaded.
Boundary file must be parsed first to retreive plane names and their types.
Files 'p' and 'U' must be rewritten accordingly to data stored in boundary file.
