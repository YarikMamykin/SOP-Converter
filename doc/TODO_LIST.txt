## TODO LIST FILE ##
# Created for managing tasks todo 

#! DONE
1. Need to rework parsing logic of files. 
Let the '{' and '}' be main stickers for parsing boundary parts;
When parsing file the string above '{' must be readed as plane name and context between '{' and '}'
must be interpreted as appropriate values.

#! DONE
2. Need to rework after-parsing logic when backup files are loaded.
Boundary file must be parsed first to retreive plane names and their types.
Files 'p' and 'U' must be rewritten accordingly to data stored in boundary file.

#! DONE
3. Need to implement logic of reading value of boundary in 'p','U' and 'boundary' files.
Suggested next === 3.1. Capture buffer;
                   3.2.1. Cut buffer string from '(' to ')' # only for U file !!!!  
		   3.2.2. Cut buffer after word 'uniform'   # only for p file !!!!

#! DONE
4. Investigate 'transportProperties' nu string meaning --> see UserGuide.pdf page 105 (paragraph 4.2.6)
Implement appropriate map for parsing file 'transportProperties'.

#! DONE
5. Implement Parser::syncFiles logic. Need to make it multithread (if possible) or async.
- syncFile slot must recieve file to sync via std::shared_ptr.
- there we create temp file and input actual values of synced maps.
- then remove original file context with temp file context.

#! NOT DONE
6. Implement file sync for boundary, controlDict and transportProperties files.
Need to be done before next task!!!

#! DONE
7. Manage Parser::notifyAll signal usage for SetTable.

#! NOT DONE
8. Implement cells logic for SetTable::Cells class. Don't forget about task 6!
