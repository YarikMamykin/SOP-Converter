## TODO LIST FILE ##
# Created for managing tasks todo 

#! DONE
1. Need to rework parsing logic of files. 
Let the '{' and '}' be main stickers for parsing boundary parts;
When parsing file the string above '{' must be readed as plane name and context between '{' and '}'
must be interpreted as appropriate values.

#! DONE
2. Need to rework after-parsing logic when backup files are loaded.
Boundary file must be parsed first to retreive plane names and their types.
Files 'p' and 'U' must be rewritten accordingly to data stored in boundary file.

#! DONE
3. Need to implement logic of reading value of boundary in 'p','U' and 'boundary' files.
Suggested next === 3.1. Capture buffer;
                   3.2.1. Cut buffer string from '(' to ')' # only for U file !!!!  
		   3.2.2. Cut buffer after word 'uniform'   # only for p file !!!!

#! DONE
4. Investigate 'transportProperties' nu string meaning --> see UserGuide.pdf page 105 (paragraph 4.2.6)
Implement appropriate map for parsing file 'transportProperties'.

#! DONE
5. Implement Parser::syncFiles logic. Need to make it multithread (if possible) or async.
- syncFile slot must recieve file to sync via std::shared_ptr.
- there we create temp file and input actual values of synced maps.
- then remove original file context with temp file context.

#! NOT DONE
6. Implement file sync for boundary, controlDict and transportProperties files.
Need to be done before next task!!!
#!____________________________________________________________________________#!

#! DONE
7. Manage Parser::notifyAll signal usage for SetTable.

#! DONE
8. Implement cells logic for SetTable::Cells class.

#! DONE (Fix is in signal file write to log file) 
9. Figure out what is wrong with Ui destroy logging.

#! DONE
10. Implement update cells logic

#! DONE
11. ClientManager must be provided to Ui components through MainWindow to have ability to connect to any signal from Ui components.

#! DONE
12. Adept table functionality to workspace changing event. Use idea from task 11.

#! DONE
13. Implement table for controlDict properties.

#! DONE
14. Implement Ui enable. Change Save settings button to STOP calculation."

#! NOT DONE
15. Implement Synchronizer class logic. It must synchronize UI data with Parser maps and so on to appropriate files"
Implement SynchronizerThread to make synchronizing mutlithread.

#! NOT DONE
16. Change Parser std::map to std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>*>. Order of file data must NOT be changed!"
